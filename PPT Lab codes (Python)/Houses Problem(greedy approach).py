Question:- There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it.

 A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbours left and right side.

What is the maximum stolen value?

Sample Input: val[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 5}

Sample Output: 20
