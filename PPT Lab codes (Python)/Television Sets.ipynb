    "# Problem Description\n",
    "# Dr. Vishnu is opening a new world class hospital in a small\n",
    "# town designed to be the first preference of the patients in\n",
    "# the city. Hospital has N rooms of two types - with TV and\n",
    "# without TV, with daily rates of R1 and R2 respectively. \n",
    "# However, from his experience Dr. Vishnu knows that the\n",
    "# number of patients is not constant throughout the year,\n",
    "# instead it follows a pattern. The number of patients on any\n",
    "# given day of the year is given by the following formula â€“ \n",
    "# (6-M)^2 + |D-15| where\n",
    "# M is the number of month (1 for jan, 2 for feb ...12 for dec)\n",
    "# and\n",
    "# D is the date (1,2...31).\n",
    "# All patients prefer without TV rooms as they are cheaper,\n",
    "# but will opt for with TV rooms only if without TV rooms are\n",
    "# not available. Hospital has a revenue target for the first\n",
    "# year of operation. Given this target and the values of N, R1\n",
    "# and R2 you need to identify the number of TVs the hospital\n",
    "# should buy so that it meets the revenue target. Assume the\n",
    "# Hospital opens on 1st Jan and year is a non-leap year. \n",
    "# Constraints\n",
    "# Hospital opens on 1st Jan in an ordinary year\n",
    "# 5 <= Number of rooms <= 100\n",
    "\n",
    "# 500 <= Room Rates <= 5000\n",
    "# 0 <= Target revenue < 90000000\n",
    "# Input Format\n",
    "# First line provides an integer N that denotes the number of\n",
    "# rooms in the hospital\n",
    "# Second line provides two space-delimited integers that\n",
    "# denote the rates of rooms with TV (R1) and without TV (R2)\n",
    "# respectively\n",
    "# Third line provides the revenue target\n",
    "# Output\n",
    "# Minimum number of TVs the hospital needs to buy to meet\n",
    "# its revenue target. If it cannot achieve its target, print the\n",
    "# total number of rooms in the hospital.\n",
    "# Timeout\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# Test Case\n",
    "# Example 1\n",
    "# Input\n",
    "# 20\n",
    "# 1500 1000\n",
    "# 7000000\n",
    "# Output\n",
    "# 14 \n",
    "# Explanation\n",
    "# Using the formula, number of patients on 1st Jan will be\n",
    "# 39, on 2nd Jan will be 38 and so on. Considering there are\n",
    "# only twenty rooms and rates of both type of rooms are\n",
    "# 1500 and 1000 respectively, we will need 14 TV sets to get\n",
    "# revenue of 7119500. With 13 TV sets Total revenue will be\n",
    "# less than 7000000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2\n",
    "# Input\n",
    "# 10\n",
    "# 1000 1500\n",
    "# 10000000\n",
    "# Output\n",
    "# 10\n",
    "# Explanation\n",
    "# In the above example, the target will not be achieved, even\n",
    "# by equipping all the rooms with TV. Hence, the answer is 10\n",
    "# i.e. total number of rooms in the hospital."
